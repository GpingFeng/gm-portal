# gm portal ☀️

This is the repository for the [gm portal](https://gmportal.xyz).

Contracts can be found in the [`contracts`](./contracts) directory, and the frontend in [`frontend`](./frontend).

## What is GM?

GM means good morning. It's GM o'clock somewhere, so there's never a bad time to say GM, Gm, or gm.

## Getting Started

First, head to the facuet to get your bubs testnet tokens.

Then, you will need to connect your Ethereum wallet below to the Bubs Rollup to display the posts from the smart contract and post a GM.

## Nice, what's going on under the hood?

This gm portal is built with Celestia, OP Stack, & Caldera.

The gm portal is a smart contract demo on a rollup built on Celestia to provide data availability and consensus, leveraging the OP Stack as the execution environment.

This allows users to securely create and share blog posts on the blockchain without the need for a centralized server or authority.

## Adding your contributions

<!-- This site was built with a mix of the [Ethermint with Rollkit tutorial](https://rollkit.dev/docs/tutorials/ethermint)
and [Celestia's full stack modular blockchain development guide](https://docs.celestia.org/developers/full-stack-modular-development-guide/).
The smart contract on this dapp was deployed with Foundry. -->
