# GM Portal

This is the repository for the [GM Portal](https://gmportal.xyz).

Contracts can be found in the [`contracts`](./contracts) directory, and the frontend in [`frontend`](./frontend).

## What is GM?
GM means good morning. It's GM o'clock somewhere, so there's never a bad time to say GM, Gm, or gm.

## Getting Started
First, DM me at [@JoshCStein](https://twitter.com/JoshCStein) or [joshcs.lens](https://www.lensfrens.xyz/joshcs.lens) with your Ethereum wallet address to receive EMINT tokens.

Then, you will need to connect your Ethereum wallet below to the Ethermint Sovereign Rollup to display the posts from the smart contract and post a GM. You only need EMINT to post.

## Nice, what's going on under the hood?
This GM Portal is built with Celestia, RollKit, & Ethermint.

The GM Portal is a sovereign rollup built on Celestia to provide data availability and consensus, leveraging Ethermint with RollKit as the execution environment.

This allows users to securely create and share blog posts on the blockchain without the need for a centralized server or authority.
